## An Introduction to Javascript
It has been quite a while since I spent an _entire_ day writing code. It reminds me of my initial days at my job where I built the entire system simulator from scratch. Writing such code is a very refreshing experience and time does fly away. Today, I got a chance to play around with **JavaScript** and made two quizzes. I still need to learn a lot beofre I can build the type of quizzes I have in mind. I am hoping I would become a half-decent developer by next week. 

### A Meaningful Day
As I mentioned beofre, I am reading _The Book of Joy_ and in that Dalai Lama talks about meaningful days. His meaningful day comprises of being compassionate. I am trying to define what a meaningful day would look like for me. To me, every day should be some learning expereince. We should know something new that we did not know the day before. Or we need to create something that did not exist before. Or we should impart learning in others. One of the things I want to undertake during my sabbatical is to teach my daughters in the way I think things should be taught. I am hoping I can show them the _Joy of Learning_.
