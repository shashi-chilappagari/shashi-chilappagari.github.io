## An Introduction to Markdown 
I have decided to take a self-sponsored sabbatical to pursue my own interests. I am writing this post as I am learning how to use Markdown. The first thing they teach in markdown is how to _italicize_. The next thing is how to make text look **bold**. It is obvious that once we know how to make one word into italics, we can make _multiple words into intalics_. Similar statement holds good for **making multiple words bold**. It goes without saying that we can make **_multiple words both bold and italic_**. I am kind of loving this interactive tutorials.

After making things bold and italicized, I am moving onto to headers and how to control their size. This sounds relatively easy. If I were to write a book, it would probably use these headers. It was suggested not to use header1 and header6 very frequently. So, I will use headers 2,3,4 & 5. It also looks like headers can be italicized but cannot be made bold.

With the basics out of the way, I started learning how to add links. Linking is a very important aspect. This tutorial is from [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/). This whole thing is **really** fascinating as I get to learn a lot. It looks like links can be added in headings too, so I will try that out later. 

If there are multiple places which lead to the same link, we can give it a tag and refer the tag only once. The obvious advantage being if the common link changes, we need to change it only once. For example, if I keep on referring to [Wikipedia] [wikilink], multiple times in a document, I can just add the link once.

We can of course add images. Once we know how to add links, images are pretty much the same. Here is a picture depicting the Pythagoras theorem from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).

One feature that I love about markdown is how it allows the usage of block quotes. I am currently reading _The Book of Joy_ by _His Holiness the_ **Dalai Lama**, _Archbishop_ **Desmond Tutu** with Douglas Abrams. The Dalai Lama quoted the below Tibetean saying.
>"Wherever you have friends that's your country, and wherever you receive love, that's your home"

What a great man and what a wonderful saying!. I suggest everyone to read this wonderful book. 

Creating lists is a very important aspect of blogging. For example, I was out grocery shopping today and would have benefited from having the below list.
* Milk
* Cereal
* Yogurt
* Instant coffee

I know what you are thinking. How can this person drink instant coffee? It is actually not tha bad. I am not in the mood to shell out some money to buy a coffee machine. 

Unordered lists are fine but we also need numbered list. For example, somone might be wondering what does one need to go on a sabbatical. They need to look at the list below.
1. Some cash reserves: depending on the time
2. A set of good problems to work on
3. A set of new things to learn
4. A set of good books to read
5. A supporting family

Obviously, the list is no particular order:)

It looks like we can have paragraphs within lists. This is a good feature if we want to add some explanations to list items.

Something like how I want my typical day to look
1. Go to a morning walk

   Today, I should remmeber to check out a new place.
 
2. Buy groceries

   _Do not_ forget the **coffee**!!!
 
3. Learn markdown

   Make sure to write the blog simulatneoulsy. As the saying goes
   >Kill two birds with one stone

I just learnt that it is possible to have soft breaks. The above itinerary could have been formatted much better. Maybe tomorrow's schedule will look better
1. Go to a morning walk  
Try to find some place which has 3 miles of walking trail.

2. Call my friends  
See if they want to join you for lunch

3. Take a _siesta_  
Don't tell the **wife**

Looks like that is the end of the basic features of markdown. Good enough to start serious blogging (links, lists, images, quotes, italics, bold, headers). Will learn more about advanced features soon.
