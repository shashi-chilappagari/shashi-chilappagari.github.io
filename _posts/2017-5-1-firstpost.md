## An Introduction to Markdown 
I have decided to take a self-sponsored sabbatical to pursue my own interests. I am writing this post as I am learning how to use Markdown. The first thing they teach in markdown is how to _italicize_. The next thing is how to make text look **bold**. It is obvious that once we know how to make one word into italics, we can make _multiple words into intalics_. Similar statement holds good for **making multiple words bold**. It goes without saying that we can make **_multiple words both bold and italic_**. I am kind of loving this interactive tutorials.

After making things bold and italicized, I am moving onto to headers and how to control their size. This sounds relatively easy. If I were to write a book, it would probably use these headers. It was suggested not to use header1 and header6 very frequently. So, I will use headers 2,3,4 & 5. It also looks like headers can be italicized but cannot be made bold.

With the basics out of the way, I started learning how to add links. Linking is a very important aspect. This tutorial is from [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/). This whole thing is **really** fascinating as I get to learn a lot. It looks like links can be added in headings too, so I will try that out later. 

If there are multiple places which lead to the same link, we can give it a tag and refer the tag only once. The obvious advantage being if the common link changes, we need to change it only once. For example, if I keep on referring to [Wikipedia] [wikilink], multiple times in a document, I can just add the link once.

We can of course add images. Once we know how to add links, images are pretty much the same. Here is a picture depicting the Pythagoras theorem from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/).

One feature that I love about markdown is how it allows the usage of block quotes. I am currently reading _The Book of Joy_ by _His Holiness the_ **Dalai Lama**, _Archbishop_ **Desmond Tutu** with Douglas Abrams. The Dalai Lama quoted the below Tibetean saying.
>"Wherever you have friends that's your country, and wherever you receive love, that's your home"

What a great man and what a wonderful saying!. I suggest everyone to read this wonderful book. 

Creating lists is a very important aspect of blogging. For example, I was out grocery shopping today and would have benefited from having the below list.
* Milk
* Cereal
* Yogurt
* Instant coffee

I know what you are thinking. How can this person drink instant coffee? It is actually not tha bad. I am not in the mood to shell out some money to buy a coffee machine. 

Unordered lists are fine but we also need numbered list. For example, somone might be wondering what does one need to go on a sabbatical. They need to look at the list below.
1. Some cash reserves: depending on the time
2. A set of good problems to work on
3. A set of new things to learn
4. A set of good books to read
5. A supporting family

Obviously, the list is no particular order:)

It looks like we can have paragraphs within lists. This is a good feature if we want to add some explanations to list items.

Something like how I want my typical day to look
1. Go to a morning walk

   Today, I should remmeber to check out a new place.
 
2. Buy groceries

   _Do not_ forget the **coffee**!!!
 
3. Learn markdown

   Make sure to write the blog simulatneoulsy. As the saying goes
