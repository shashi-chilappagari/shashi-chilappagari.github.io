## An Introduction to Markdown 
I have decided to take a self-sponsored sabbatical to pursue my own interests. I am writing this post as I am learning how to use Markdown. The first thing they teach in markdown is how to _italicize_. The next thing is how to make text look **bold**. It is obvious that once we know how to make one word into italics, we can make _multiple words into intalics_. Similar statement holds good for **making multiple words bold**. It goes without saying that we can make **_multiple words both bold and italic_**. I am kind of loving this interactive tutorials.

After making things bold and italicized, I am moving onto to headers and how to control their size. This sounds relatively easy. If I were to write a book, it would probably use these headers. It was suggested not to use header1 and header6 very frequently. So, I will use headers 2,3,4 & 5. It also looks like headers can be italicized but cannot be made bold.

With the basics out of the way, I started learning how to add links. Linking is a very important aspect. This tutorial is from [Markdown Tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/). This whole thing is **really** fascinating as I get to learn a lot. It looks like links can be added in headings too, so I will try that out later. 

If there are multiple places which lead to the same link, we can give it a tag and refer the tag only once. The abvious advantage being if the common link changes, we need to change it only once. For example, if I keep on refrring to [Wikipedia] [wikilink], multiple times in a document, I can just add the link once.
